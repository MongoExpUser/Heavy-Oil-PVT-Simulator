<h3>Heavy-Oil-PVT-Simulator</h3>
This module implements the "Peng-Robison EOS" for a 3-phase system. 
<br>
It calculates relevant non-isothermal PVT properties that can be used: <br>
a) To describe a given heavy oil/bitumen sample. <br>
b) As input input into a thermal numerical reservoir simulator.
