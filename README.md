<h2>Heavy Oil PVT Simulator</h2>
This module implements the "Peng-Robison EOS" for a 3-phase system. <br> <br>
It calculates relevant non-isothermal PVT properties that can be used:  <br>
a) To describe or characterize a given heavy oil/bitumen sample.  <br>
b) As input into a thermal numerical reservoir simulator. <br>
